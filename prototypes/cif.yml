    CIF allows you to combine known malicious threat information
    from many sources and use that information for identification
    (incident response), detection (IDS) and mitigation (null route).
    The most common types of threat intelligence warehoused in CIF
    are IP addresses, domains and urls that are observed to be
    related to malicious activity.
